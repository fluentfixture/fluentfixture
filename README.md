## Introduction

The FluentFixture is a flexible tool for generating customizable mock data with a fluent interface.

## Philosophy

> In Informatics, dummy data is benign information that does not contain any useful data, but serves to reserve space where real data is nominally present. 
> Dummy data can be used as a placeholder for both testing and operational purposes. 
> For testing, dummy data can also be used as stubs or pad to avoid software testing issues by ensuring that all variables and data fields are occupied. (â†ª[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_data))

In software development, generating mock data is a crucial necessity. In most cases, the test data quality directly impacts the development quality and velocity. 
But when it comes to generating conditional and complex mock data, things get a little more challenging. There are many dummy / mock / fixture data generators in the javascript ecosystem, 
but most have an unclean interface and limited capabilities. 

The FluentFixture aims to provide a fluent interface and an extensible architecture. 
For this reason, the core of the package focuses on programmability, fluent interface, and extensibility.

> The **FluentFixture** does not provide predefined data like FakerJS for now. However, realistic data features will plan after the stable version of the core package, no-code support, and CLI.
